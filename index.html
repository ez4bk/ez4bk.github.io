                          technologies and protocols that operate in different layers. All protocols and technologies
                          are covered in a holistic framework with an emphasis on their effect on the network and
                          application performance. The course also includes a brief introduction of more modern
                          concepts in the field of networking such as SDN and NFV to encourage deeper study of those
                          topics.
